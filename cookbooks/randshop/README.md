Randshop installation Cookbook
==============================

This cookbook installs all system components needed to run a 
Randshop (http://www.randshop.com/).

Requirements
------------

Tested with Chef version 0.11.8.2 but maybe older versions will work as well.

I use CentOS 6.5 as vagrant base box from http://nrel.github.io/vagrant-boxes/
and Amazon Linux AMI 2013.09.2 for EC2. Others might work as well.
